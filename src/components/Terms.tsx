            out how we keep your yard clean, fresh, and paws-itively poop-free.
            By signing up for our Services, you&apos;re giving us the green

            Your pups might be protective, but we need safe, open access to do
            our job. If we encounter locked gates, frosty latches, or aggressive
            doggos, we‚Äôll have to skip that visit ‚Äî but charges will still
            apply. Need us to come back? A $5 tail-chasing fee applies. Don‚Äôt
            worry ‚Äî all the doo will be scooped up during your next scheduled
            cleanup!
