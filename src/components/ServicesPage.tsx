            Welcome to Poo Patrol ‚Äî where we handle the doo, so you don‚Äôt have
            to! These tail-waggin' Terms of Service ("Terms") lay out how we
            keep your yard clean, fresh, and paws-itively poop-free. By signing
            up for our Services, you're giving us the green light to scoop the
            poop, one paw-print at a time.

            Your pups might be protective, but we need safe, open access to do
            our job. If we encounter locked gates, frosty latches, or aggressive
            doggos, we‚Äôll have to skip that visit ‚Äî but charges will still
            apply. Need us to come back? A&nbsp;$5 tail-chasing fee applies.
            Don‚Äôt worry ‚Äî all the doo will be scooped up during your next
            scheduled cleanup!

            (lightning, snow piles, or heatwaves), we‚Äôll have to skip for
            safety. No refunds for missed visits; we‚Äôll catch all the extra poop
            next time around.
